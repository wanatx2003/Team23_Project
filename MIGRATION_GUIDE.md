### Database Changes

- Added volunteer management tables (EventDetails, VolunteerMatches, VolunteerHistory, etc.)

## How to Complete the Migration

1. **Run the cleanup script:**
   ```bash
   cleanup-library-files.bat
   ```

2. **Update the database:**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p"!Mm042326323" < sql/volunteer_management.sql
   ```

3. **Remove any remaining library references:**
   - Check `App.js` for any remaining library imports
   - Remove any library-related CSS imports
   - Clean up any library-related API calls

4. **Test the volunteer management features:**
   - User registration and profile completion
   - Event creation and management (admin)
   - Volunteer matching (admin)
   - Event signup (volunteers)
   - Notification system
   - Volunteer history tracking

## New System Features

### For Volunteers:
- Complete profile with skills and availability
- Browse and sign up for events
- Receive notifications for assignments
- Track volunteer history and hours

### For Administrators:
- Create and manage events
- Match volunteers to events based on skills
- Send notifications to volunteers
- Track volunteer participation and performance

### Database Schema:
- UserCredentials: Login and basic info
- UserProfile: Detailed profile with location and skills
- EventDetails: Event information and requirements
- VolunteerMatches: Volunteer-event assignments
- VolunteerHistory: Participation tracking
- Notifications: System notifications

The system is now fully focused on volunteer management with no library-related functionality remaining.
